The looping statements available in C++ are :

1) For loop

2) While loop

3) Do .. While loop

ðŸ”´ For Loop

For loop can be used in C++ programming to repeat a specific execution 
for specific number of times. This helps us to avoid writing multiple 
lines of code and bring everything into a single line.
 The syntax of for loop is :

 for (variable initialization; condition; increment operation)
 {
 //loop statements;
 }




ðŸ”´ While Loop

While loop can be used when you want to a statement to execute continuously
 till the condition specified is true. The difference between for loop and
 while loop is with for loop, you will know how many times the loop will 
execute. With while loop, you will not know the number of iterations till
 the program exits from the loop when the condition does not match.
 The syntax of for loop is :

 while (condition)
 {
 //loop statements;
 }



ðŸ”´ Do .. While Loop

The basic difference between for loop, while loop and do while loop
 is that in do while loop, the condition is checked at the bottom
 of the loop. In the do while loop, the body of the loop will be
 executed first and then the condition will be evaluated. This ensures
 that the statement is executed at least once even if the condition is
 not satisfied.
 The syntax of do while loop is :

 do
 {
 // statement execution;
 }
 while(condition);
